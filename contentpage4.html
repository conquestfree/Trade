        <h1>Life-Enhancing Solutions</h1>
        <p>So are you ready? Some of the only things you need to get improved are:
            <ol>
                <li>VISA, MasterCard, American Express, wire transfer bank card number, or 
                    Suica in Japan, that you should make
                    specifically available on the <span class="bold-text">edge of your 
                        dining table or kitchen counter (those obvious locations)</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>A slip of paper with your request of service noted, details, and target recipient's name (Templates need a printer to
                        print them - a sample near the bottom)</li>
                    <li>The amount you expect to pay (you calculate it first)</li>
                    <li>A phone, device or computer with email access and a real account (IMPORTANT!)</li>
                    <li class="bold-text">Valid signature</li>
                    <li class="italic-text">The Trick: Pray for the order to go through by God</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
<p>
Regarding the rules: firstly, orders can be written and processed, but not 
finalized until you realize any change in your life. If the change is not accepted 
at your later discretion, we will confirm that you want to get a full 98% or 99% 
of your money back, and will with much certainty be returned.
</p>
<p>
There is one good way to confirm your order:
</p>
<p>
1. An email that will be sent to your specified inbox on your order.
</p>
        <p>
        2. You can use a PC, Mac, or smartphone with 4G or 5G, or Wifi-enabled device
        with E-MAIL ACCOUNT, like on an iPhone or a Samsung tablet, for example.
        Checks are also OK if you specify just what you need on the back of the check. 
        We will process your check without touching it.
        </p>

        <p>3. If your order has been delayed very long, that's because we 
       may have long backorders of the same product, and are currently
       dealing with everyone's information. Also, sometimes there are problems with your
       card - for example you are almost over your limit, and the order did not go through.
       We will send any news about your order and new prices to your email inbox.</p>
        <p>Prices on that site and this one are due to change without notice.</p>

        <p>Send a standard email with your new order, or to inquire about an already made 
        order. Use this on your device: gc-inquiries@host.com</p>

<h3 class="">Why customers might not get their orders through</h3>
<ol class="">
    <li>Your card did not go through as expected (your card does not have high enough limit). Try a different card, or basically pay off your credit
         fully, and try again.</li>
        <li>You specified an order detail errantly, and we are in disagreement. There are many
        reasons for an order error like this, so there is not one definite answer to it. But of course
        you could change your specifications and try again.</li>
        <li>Simple reason that the GC Directors did not achieve your order specs appropriately, or you and
        the GC Directors could not arrive at an appropriate outcome. Disagreements can be solved
        but one certain thing is that the customer is NOT always right. So please heed the warnings
        provided by the GC Director and come up with either a compromise, or cancel the order. Body and brain
        improvements are not to be taken lightly! And our Directors are always perfectly right.<br>
        *make sure you read carefully the issue with your order in your email.<br></li>
