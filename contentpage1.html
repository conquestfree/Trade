        <h1>Beauty Improvements At Your Demand</h1>
        <p>So are you ready? Some of the only things you need to get improved are:
            <ol>
                <li>VISA, MasterCard, American Express, or Suica in Japan, that you should
                specifically make available on the <span class="bold-text">bottom corner of 
                your bedside table, or work table, or office table</span>
                (in a place where it can't be stolen)</li>
                <li>A slip of paper with your request of service noted, details, and target recipient's name (Templates need a printer to
                print them - a sample near the bottom)</li>
                <li>The amount you expect to pay in USD (you calculate and exchange the US dollar amount first)</li>
                <li>A phone, device or computer with email access and a real account (IMPORTANT!)</li>
                <li class="bold-text">Valid signature</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
Regarding the rules: firstly, orders can be written and processed, but not 
finalized until you realize any change in your life. If the change is not accepted 
at your late discretion, we will confirm that you want to get a full 98% or 99% 
of your money back, and will with much certainty be returned.
        </p>
<p>
There is one good way to confirm your order:
</p>
<p>
1. An email that will be sent to your specified inbox on your order.
</p>
<p>
        2. You can use a PC, Mac, or smartphone with 4G or 5G, or Wifi-enabled device
        with E-MAIL ACCOUNT, like on an iPhone or a Samsung tablet, for example.
        Checks are also OK if you specify just what you need on the back of the check. 
        We will process your check without touching it.
        </p>

        <p>3. If your order has been delayed very long, that's because we 
       may have long backorders of the same product, and are currently
       dealing with everyone's information. Also, sometimes there are problems with your
       card - for example you are almost over your limit, and the order did not go through.
       We will send any news about your order and new prices to your email inbox.</p>
        <p>Prices on that site and this one are due to change without notice.</p>

    <h3 class="">Why customers might not get their orders through</h3>
    <ol class="">
        <li>Your card did not go through as expected (your card does not have high enough limit). Try a different card, or basically pay off your credit
            fully, and try again.</li>
            <li>You specified an order detail errantly, and we are in disagreement. There are many
            reasons for an order error like this, so there is not one definite answer to it. But of course
            you could change your specifications and try again.</li>
            <li>Simple reason that the GC Directors did not achieve your order specs appropriately, or you and
            the GC Directors could not arrive at an appropriate outcome. Disagreements can be solved
            but one certain thing is that the customer is NOT always right. So please heed the warnings
            provided by the GC Director and come up with either a compromise, or cancel the order. Body and brain
            improvements are not to be taken lightly! And our Directors are always perfectly right.<br>
